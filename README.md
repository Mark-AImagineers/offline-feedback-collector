# Offline Feedback Collector

A mobile-first web app that helps offline businesses collect structured customer feedback through QR codes — no apps, no logins, just clean and quick surveys.

## Overview

This project is a real-world Django + Bootstrap 5 learning build.

It simulates a useful, business-oriented tool: collecting customer feedback in physical locations such as food stalls, clinics, or kiosks. Customers scan a QR code, answer a short survey, and their responses are saved to a dashboard — all without installing an app.

- No accounts needed for respondents  
- Mobile-first, Bootstrap 5 frontend  
- Teachable architecture with clean patterns  
- Useful for portfolio, job applications, or real deployment

## Goals

- Practice building a production-ready Django app using a custom Bootstrap 5 theme
