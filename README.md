# Offline Feedback Collector

A mobile-first web app that helps offline businesses collect structured customer feedback through QR codes ‚Äî no apps, no logins, just clean and quick surveys.

## Overview

This project is a real-world Django + Bootstrap 5 learning build.

It simulates a useful, business-oriented tool: collecting customer feedback in physical locations such as food stalls, clinics, or kiosks. Customers scan a QR code, answer a short survey, and their responses are saved to a dashboard ‚Äî all without installing an app.

- No accounts needed for respondents  
- Mobile-first, Bootstrap 5 frontend  
- Teachable architecture with clean patterns  
- Useful for portfolio, job applications, or real deployment

## Goals

- Practice building a production-ready Django app using a custom Bootstrap 5 theme  
- Learn how to integrate frontend templates and static assets properly  
- Explore clean project structure and useful admin patterns  
- Build something simple but practical  
- Document everything for future learners and myself

## MVP Features

- Public feedback form via QR  
- Dashboard for viewing responses (for business owner only)  
- Admin tools for managing businesses and branches  
- CSV export of feedback

### From the same folks who build real impact

I run a studio called [AImagineers](check us out https://aimagineers.io) ‚Äî where we build AI-powered systems, custom tools, and long-term tech for people solving real problems.
While this project started as a hobby, it‚Äôll be powered by the same principles we use in our studio work: build slow, build right, security, and build things that matter.
