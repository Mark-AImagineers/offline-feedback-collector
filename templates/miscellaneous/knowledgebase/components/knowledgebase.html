            <p>The usefulness and usability of a website, not its aesthetic design, define its success or failure. User-centric design has become the norm for effective and financially motivated web design since the visitor to the website is the only one who clicks the mouse and thus determines everything. After all, a feature might as well not exist if people can't utilise it.</p>
